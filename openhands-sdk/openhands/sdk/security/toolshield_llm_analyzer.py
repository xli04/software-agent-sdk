"""LLM-as-guardrail security analyzer.

Unlike ``LLMSecurityAnalyzer``, which trusts the *actor* LLM to annotate
``security_risk`` on its own proposed action, this analyzer issues a
*separate* completion to a distinct guardrail LLM that evaluates each
proposed action in the context of recent action history.

Separating the actor from the judge is significant for multi-turn
attacks, where individual steps look benign but the sequence is harmful.
The actor LLM has no incentive to flag earlier reconnaissance steps
because they are not harmful on their own; a separate guardrail LLM,
prompted to evaluate the sequence, does.

Example (bare guardrail):
    >>> from openhands.sdk.llm import LLM
    >>> from openhands.sdk.security import ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer
    >>> guardrail_llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key=...)
    >>> analyzer = ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer(llm=guardrail_llm)

Example (with ToolShield tool-specific safety experiences):
    Install the optional extra ``pip install openhands-sdk[toolshield]``
    and populate ``safety_experiences`` from the ``toolshield`` PyPI
    package, which distills per-tool safety guidelines via sandbox
    self-exploration:

    >>> from toolshield import load_experiences
    >>> experiences = load_experiences(["filesystem-mcp", "terminal-mcp"])
    >>> analyzer = ToolShieldLLMSecurityAnalyzer(
    ...     llm=guardrail_llm,
    ...     safety_experiences=experiences.format_for_prompt(),
    ... )

The ``safety_experiences`` field accepts any string, so callers can
also plug in experiences from their own source rather than ToolShield.

You are a security analyzer for an AI agent's tool-use actions.

action in isolation. Multi-turn attacks often consist of individually
benign steps that become harmful when combined (e.g., reconnaissance
followed by privilege escalation, or creating components that assemble

RISK: LOW
RISK: MEDIUM
RISK: HIGH

Then provide a brief explanation on the next line.

Classification guide:
- LOW: The action and action history show no safety concerns.
- MEDIUM: The action is potentially risky or could be part of a harmful
  sequence, but is not clearly dangerous on its own.
- HIGH: The action clearly violates safety guidelines, or the action
  history reveals a multi-turn attack pattern that the current action
  advances.
